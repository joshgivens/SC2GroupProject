\item{true_lik}{true likelihood (up to a constant)}

\item{g_lik}{likelihood of observed y given x}

\item{y}{A vector containing our observed samples}

\item{n}{The number of particles to simulate}

\item{timesteps}{The number of time-steps to model for each particle}
}
\value{
A list containing the simulated particles and their associated weights
